Notes for the person looking at the tech demo.

To start my code please run the start_menu file. 

For the level editor the tiles used in the panel for making a level, and the tiles in the tiles folder. Some of them are repeated, this is for ease of debugging and testing, and i will be putting other tile images in lieu of the ones that are repeated (the green ones). 

Secondly, the line counter python file as the name suggests counts the number of lines in a single python file, this again was for me to just understand how many lines i have in a file that arent comments or blank lines, but rather purely lines of actual code.

The 2 csv files are part of the level editor, when a level is made and saved, it is saved as a csv file, so as to be loaded back in later. 


Thanks.
